           <p class="card-text">The U.S. is experiencing a growing population of African immigrants/refugees. 
              This population disproportionately experiences high rates of mental health concerns, specifically young adults’ 
              experience concerns such as trauma, and negative experiences with relocation. This study aims to better understand
               the stigma and barriers related to mental health service access for young adults in the East African community.
                Doing so will help inform culturally responsive approaches to address the needs faced by this population. 
                This pilot study provides an in-depth understanding of the stigma and barriers associated with mental 
                health and access to services for young adults in the East African Community. Findings suggest that 
                increased awareness related to stigma and how this impacts service utilization within this community is needed. 
                Additionally, practitioners should be informed about mental health-related stigma so that they can provide 
                culturally appropriate and responsive services to this community. The current study employs a qualitative 
                design to address the following research question: How can we understand mental health stigma and barriers 
                to mental health services for young adults in the East African community? Semi-structured interviews were 
                conducted with three young adults aged 18-25 who identify as East African. Questions focused on background and immigration experience, mental health, and availability and accessibility of mental health services. Interviews were transcribed and coded deductively using a predetermined coding scheme that aligned with the study objective. Thematic analysis was used to condense codes into broader themes, with data source triangulation used as a strategy to enhance credibility and trustworthiness. Themes emerged which highlighted barriers, supports, and combinations of both. Barriers included misinformation, lack of awareness, intra-community gossip, and lack of available and culturally specific services. Supports focused primary on social networks. Religion was seen as both a barrier and a support, operating as a coping mechanism while perpetuating stigma about mental illness.
